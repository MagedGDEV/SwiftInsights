# Variables

In Swift, variables provide a way to store data that can change during the execution of a program. This data can either be input by the user or displayed on the screen. Swift uses the keyword **`var`** to declare variables.

## Declaring a Variable

To create a variable, use the following syntax:

```swift
var variableName
```

- **`var`**: A keyword that tells Swift to create a new variable.
- **`variableName`**: A developer-defined name that describes the purpose of the variable.

## Intializing a Variable

You can assign an initial value to a variable when you declare it. For example:

```swift
var myName = "Maged Elesseily"
```

- **`=`**: The assignment operator that stores the value in the variable.
- **`" "`**: Double quotes indicate a string value (explained later in this branch).

After this code, the variable **`myName`** holds the value **`"Maged Elesseily"`**.

## Changing the Value of a Variable

Variables are mutable, meaning their value can be updated after they are created:

```swift
var status
status = "Available"
status = "Busy"
```

- **`var status`**: Declares a variable named **`status`**.
- **`status = "Available"`**: Initializes status with the value **`"Available"`**.
- **`status = "Busy"`**: Updates the value of status to **`"Busy"`**.

>[!WARNING]
> Using **`var`** again after **`status`** has been created would give an error as you are trying to create a new variable with a variable name that already exists

### Rules for Naming Variables

When naming variables in Swift, follow these rules:

1. Variable names **must start with a letter (or an underscore _)** and can contain letters, numbers, and underscores.
2. **No spaces** are allowed in variable names. Use naming conventions to improve readability.
3. **Case Sensitivity**: Variable names are case-sensitive. For example, myName and myname are treated as two different variables.
4. **Avoid Reserved Words**: Do not use Swift keywords (like var, let, func) as variable names.

### Naming Conventions in Swift

Using proper naming conventions makes your code easier to read and understand. The preferred naming style in Swift is **camelCase**:

- **Camel Case**: The first word starts in lowercase, and subsequent words begin with an uppercase letter.
Examples: **`myName`**, **`totalScore`**, **`isLoggedIn`**.

Other common conventions:

- **`Pascal Case`**: Every word starts with an uppercase letter, e.g., **`MyName`**. (Not typical for variables in Swift but used for class names.)
- **`Snake Case`**: Words are separated by underscores, e.g., **`my_name`**. (Rarely used in Swift.)

#### Optional Use of Semicolons in Swift

Swift does not require a semicolon (**`;`**) at the end of each line, making the code cleaner and easier to read. However, semicolons can be used in two specific scenarios:

1. Combining Multiple Statements on One Line

    Semicolons allow you to place multiple statements on a single line for better readability or to save space.

    ```swift
    var story = "This is a long story"; var author = "Maged Elesseily"
    ```

2. Treating Two Lines of Code as One Statement

    When a line of code is split into two or more parts, semicolons help Swift recognize them as a single logical statement.

    ```swift
    var longSentence = 
    "it's easier to read when split over multiple lines.";
    ```

## Constants

In Swift, you can store data in a **constant** when you are certain that the value will never change. This is done using the **`let`** keyword.

**Syntax:**

```swift
let character = "Harry"
```

Here, **`let`** creates a constant called **`character`**, and assigns it the value **`"Harry"`**. Once set, **`character` cannot be changed** throughout the program.

### Important Points for constants

1. **Initialization is Required**

    Unlike variables, **constants must be initialized at the time of declaration.** You cannot declare a constant and assign a value to it later:

    ```swift
    let character  // Error: Constant 'character' must have an initial value
    character = "Harry"  // Error: Cannot assign to value: 'character' is a 'let' constant
    ```

2. **Immutable**

    Once a constant is initialized, its value **cannot be changed**. Trying to modify it will result in a compiler error:

    ```swift
    let character = "Harry"
    character = "Hermione"  // Error: Cannot assign to value: 'character' is a 'let' constant
    ```

3. **Memory and Performance Benefits**

- **Memory Optimization:** Constants don't need memory flagged for potential changes, unlike variables. This reduces memory overhead.
- **Compiler Optimizations:** Swift can make performance improvements, such as reordering instructions, when using constants. This cannot be done with variables since their value can change.
- **Safety and Reliability:** By using constants, you eliminate the risk of accidentally changing a value that should remain constant. This makes your code more predictable and reduces the chances of bugs.

> [!NOTE]
> Swift encourages you to use constants for values that do not need to change.

## Strings

In Swift, **strings** are used to store text data, such as names, messages, or even emojis. Strings are enclosed in double quotes (**`"`**), making it easy to represent any text you need.

**Examples:**

```swift

let message = "Welcome to Swift!"  // A simple string
let emojiText = "Coding is fun ðŸ˜Ž"  // Emojis are valid in strings
```

### Handling Special Cases in Strings

1. **Including Double Quotes**

    If your string needs to include double quotes inside it, use a **backslash (`\`)** to escape them:

    ```swift
    let quote = "She said, \"Swift makes coding fun!\""
    ```

    This ensures Swift understands that the quotes are part of the text and not the end of the string.

2. **Creating Multiline Strings**

    To span a string across multiple lines, use **three double quotes (""")**. Ensure the opening and closing quotes are on their own lines:

    ```swift
    let multilineString = """
    This is a multiline string.
    You can write across several lines.
    """
    ```

### Common String Operations in Swift

1. **Get the Length of a String**

    Use the **`.count`** property to find how many characters are in a string:

    ```swift
    let name = "Swift"
    print(name.count)  // Output: 5
    ```

2. **Convert to Uppercase**

    Use the **.uppercased()** method to convert all letters to uppercase:

    ```swift
    let lowercase = "hello"
    print(lowercase.uppercased())  // Output: "HELLO"
    ```

#### You might be wondering, what is the print() function?

In some cases, you will want to check the value stored in a variable or returned by a function. This is where the **`print()`** function becomes incredibly useful. It outputs the value to the console or terminal, allowing you to see what's happening in your program. This makes it an essential tool for debugging and understanding your code's behavior.

#### Why `.count` vs. `.uppercased()`?

- **`.count`** is a property that provides information (length of the string). It doesnâ€™t require parentheses.
- **`.uppercased()`** is a method that performs an action (converts to uppercase). It requires parentheses to execute.
This distinction will be discussed further as you explore Swift.
